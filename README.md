# Lightning Paperwallets for Bitcoin micropayments

<img src="https://papersats.io/papersats-card-mockup.png">

This project is about to build paperwallets for the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The idea is to support the spread of using Bitcoin Lightning at the point of sale and have a local analog wallet backup.

PaperSats Cards should be setup with:

- NFC Stickers for contactless use as a Boltcard at any accepting POS
- QR Code Sticker to refill and balance check.
- LNDhub Admin URL QR Sticker on the back, to let you port the Papersats Wallet to a digital device. This one is secured with an scratch sticker on top.

## What is needed to provide PaperSats?

It is recommend to setup a Bitcoin lightning node, to have full control about any transaction.

To manage the Lightning Wallets with boltcard feature, refill, balance check and lndHUB admin there is lnbits what will do the job.

The size of an business card seems to proven for carrying in a purse.

Printing the stickers can be done with a simple label printer that supports QR codes.

The boltcard has security features to prevent copying it. To write the Tags you need a NFC DNA 424 capable writer.

## To Dos
It takes some time and technical knowledge to handcraft and mange a bunch of PaperSats Cards.

1. A consistent build process, should be supported by a script that adds a bulk of wallets to lnbits an enable the Boltcard and LNDhub URL extensions. With that, all the needed keys should in the lnbits database for any further steps.

2. A web app for checking the wallet balance and refill if needed should be reachable by scanning the QR code sticker.

This is a white paper under development and will be revised from time to time.
